this is some code i've written when going through [The Little Book of Semaphores](https://greenteapress.com/wp/semaphores/) using [SPIN](https://plan9.io/sys/doc/spin.html). **contains spoilers**, obviously. go through the book yourself, ya coward

## command cheatsheet
```sh
git clean -X  # remove output files
git clean -Xn # dry run

spin whatever.pml    # single randomized run
spin -T whatever.pml # get rid of the tabs in the output
spin -run -O2 uh.pml # exhaustive search
```
