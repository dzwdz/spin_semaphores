The Poop Fart Public License (PFPL)

Version 1.0, June 2023

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION

0. YOU'RE AWARE OF THE SMELLS
   By using, copying, distributing, or modifying the software (referred
   to as "The Software" or "The Stinky One"), you agree to acknowledge
   that it might produce foul odors, including but not limited to poop,
   fart, and other malodorous emissions. You further agree not to hold
   the author responsible for any discomfort, nose-pinching, or dry
   heaving that may result from the use of The Software.

1. PERMISSION TO SMELL, MODIFY, AND DISTRIBUTE
   You are granted a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, and odoriferous
   license to smell, modify, and distribute The Software. This includes
   the right to breathe deeply, wrinkle your nose in disgust, and even
   hold your breath in extreme circumstances.

2. MODIFYING THE STINK
   When modifying The Software, you are encouraged to introduce new
   smells, fragrances, or aromas, as long as they do not infringe upon the
   nasal rights of others. The original author cannot be held accountable
   for any olfactory offenses caused by your modifications.

3. REDISTRIBUTION AND "THE STINKY CODE"
   Any redistribution of The Software must include a notice acknowledging
   the foul-smelling nature of The Software and a recommendation to
   use appropriate air fresheners while engaging with it. If you choose
   to redistribute "The Stinky Code" (i.e., a modified version of The
   Software that is even smellier), you must indicate that the code is
   not for the faint of heart, and users should proceed at their own
   risk and with plenty of fresh air.

4. WARRANTY OF ODOR
   The Software is provided "as is," without any warranty or guarantee
   of any kind, including the warranty of smell. The author cannot be
   held responsible for any discomfort, nausea, or loss of appetite
   resulting from The Software's pungency.

5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
   In no event shall the author be liable for any direct, indirect,
   incidental, special, or nasal damages, including, but not limited
   to, loss of sense of smell, damage to the olfactory system, or the
   inability to enjoy a gourmet meal due to exposure to The Software's
   stench.

6. SURVIVAL OF THE STINK
   The termination or expiration of this license does not relieve you of
   the smells emitted by The Software, which may linger indefinitely. You
   are advised to have adequate ventilation and air purification systems
   in place to deal with The Software's persistent odor.

By using, copying, distributing, or modifying The Software, you agree
to the terms and conditions of this Poop Fart Public License. May your
nostrils forever be vigilant.
